1. If the cleaned target name already exists in the same folder:
Compares file sizes.
If the existing file is same size or larger → deletes the file being processed (assumes it's a lower or equal quality duplicate).
If the current file is larger → skips renaming (keeps the better one).

2.
--cleanOptionInfo: removes _xxx where xxx is exactly 3 digits (e.g., _128, _320)
--cleanBitRateInfo: removes _xxk or _xxxk (e.g., _128k, _320k)
--cleanResolutionInfo: removes _xxxxp with any number of digits (e.g., _720p, _1080p, _4320p)

3. --precision and --dry-run

4. Shows renames in green, deletions in yellow, errors in red.

8. Music16k\皇帝圆舞曲_16k.opus → 皇帝圆舞曲__16k.opus this shouldn't be. -o "16k" -n "_16k", the old pattern should be exact match, not a substring. consecutive repetitions of "16k" or "_16k" would together be replaced by "_16k". If repetitions needed, the exact repetitions like "$ $ " would be used instead of "$ ". If there are repetitions, not matching the command line parameter, correct them.

9. The files containing "chill city pop $ $ " were having multiple "$ " the code should be able to fix repetitions. If repetitions needed, the exact repetitions like "$ $ " would be used instead of "$ ". If there are repetitions, not matching the command line parameter, correct them.

10. When mutiple files have same name (option info, resolution info removed) but have different audio bit rate(not identified from filename, identified from system info), keep all and append "_xxk" to end of filename. copy the extension. If they have same audio bit rate, only keep the one has (shortest) filename with no bit rate info and append  "_xxk" to end of filename.
